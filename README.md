## Lighthouse v2.0

### GraphQL Server for Laravel

Lighthouse is a PHP package that allows you to serve a GraphQL endpoint from your Laravel application. It greatly reduces the boilerplate required to create a schema, it integrates well with any Laravel project, and it's highly customizable giving you full control over your data.
