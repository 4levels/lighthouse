  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String
  posts: [Post!]! @hasMany
}

type Post {
  title: String!
  content: String!
  author: User @belongsTo
}

type Query {
  me: User @auth
  posts: [Post!]! @paginate
}

:::warning Rapid GraphQL Development

Lighthouse enables schema-first development by allowing you to use the native Schema Definition Language to describe your data. Leverage server-side directives to add functionality and bring your schema to life.

With nothing more than this schema file (along w/ Eloquent models and migrations set up), you have a fully functional GraphQL server with no additional code! But don't worry, you can extend Lighthouse to fit just about any data requirements. The docs will walk you through what directives are available, how to create your own directives and how to create your own resolvers, so let's get started!

:::warning Laravel & GraphQL

Lighthouse dramatically reduces the amount of boilerplate needed to get a GraphQL project up and running. Many of the familiar concepts from Laravel are converted into Lighthouse directives, so you can reuse existing logic and work the way you are used to.

If you already have your models and migrations set up, it only takes minutes to get a GraphQL server up and running with Lighthouse!

```graphql
  type Mutation {
    createPost(
      title: String! @rules(apply: ["min:2"])
      content: String! @rules(apply: ["min:12"])
    ): Post
    # Automatically create a new post model
    @create(model: "Post")
    # Inject the current user's id
    @inject(context: "user.id", attr: "user.id")
    # Fire an event with the newly created model
    @event(fire: "App\\Events\\PostCreated")
  }
```
