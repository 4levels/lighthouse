:::warning Rapid GraphQL Development with Laravel

Lighthouse dramatically reduces the amount of boilerplate needed to get a GraphQL project up and running. Many of the familiar concepts from Laravel are converted into Lighthouse directives, so you can reuse existing logic and work the way you are used to.

If you already have your models and migrations set up, it only takes minutes to get up and running with Lighthouse.
You only need to define a schema to have a fully functional GraphQL server with no additional code.

But don't worry, you can extend Lighthouse to fit just about any data requirements. The docs will walk you through what directives are available, how to create your own directives and how to create your own resolvers, so let's get started!
